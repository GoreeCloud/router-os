# GoreeCloud Router OS — Planned Features

> **Authority:** Repository-native planned-feature record  
> **Migration:** Replaces the retired `FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` / Google Drive roadmap controls. GitHub is the sole feature-state authority.

Status values in this file describe repository work, not product release acceptance.

| Priority | Work item | Lifecycle | Implementation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Milestone 0 configuration/state model | Development | Prototype implemented | Unit tests included |
| P0 | Deterministic configuration compiler | Development | Abstract-plan prototype implemented | Unit tests included |
| P0 | Safe configuration preview and review/apply consistency | Development | Privacy-safe deterministic preview and exact previous/desired review token implemented | PR #5 CI passed with 32 tests and reference-config validation; production management-lockout recovery not verified |
| P0 | Transactional apply/verify/rollback | Development | Prototype includes atomic local journal and interrupted-state reconciliation | Automated rollback/journal/recovery tests included; production recovery not verified |
| P0 | Repository governance baseline | Development | Implemented on `main` | PR #1 CI passed and merged |
| P0 | Reference Build 0.1 virtual network lab | Development | Isolated Linux namespace/veth topology scaffold and routed smoke test implemented | PR #6 CI passed: 38 unit tests, reference-config validation, routed ping with 0% packet loss, host default route unchanged, and generated namespaces removed; product routing/firewall/NAT/DHCP acceptance remains unverified |
| P0 | Privileged Linux execution adapter | Development | Namespace-only adapter implements complete preflight, allowlisted static-LAN execution, and namespace-scoped IPv4 forwarding; full Reference Build plan fails closed while required backends are absent | PR #8 exact-head CI passed: 48 unit tests, reference-config validation, routed namespace lab with 0% packet loss/unchanged host default route/clean teardown, and privileged-adapter smoke with static LAN plus IPv4 forwarding observed, unchanged host default route, and namespace removal; production privilege model and full Reference Build execution remain unverified |
| P0 | nftables firewall/NAT backend | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P0 | LAN DHCP backend | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P0 | Local authenticated management API | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P1 | Multi-environment deployment portability and installation profiles | Planned | Deployment portability contract defined for Proxmox VM, generic VM, Docker, Podman, GoreeCloud Containers, bare metal, and additional qualified targets; install artifacts/adapters are not implemented | No install profile is accepted yet; each claimed profile must pass the shared capability, network-safety, routing/firewall/NAT/DHCP, transaction/recovery, upgrade/rollback, backup/restore/migration, diagnostics, performance, and platform-conformance matrix |
| P1 | Minimal Glaze UI administration surface | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P1 | Everkeep-backed durable snapshots/recovery | Planned | Local journal/recovery proof only; Everkeep not integrated | Not accepted or production-verified |
| P1 | Privacy Shield authorization/retention enforcement | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P1 | Wardveil evidence and security-state integration | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P1 | Network/Conduit and Beacon integration contracts | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P2 | VLANs, policy routing, multi-WAN, SQM | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P2 | Wi-Fi and travel-router hardware workflows | Planned | Not implemented | Not verified |
| P3 | IDS/IPS, dynamic routing, extensions, HA | Future | Not implemented | Not verified |

## Immediate development gate

Reference Build 0.1 must remain a development artifact until routing, firewall, NAT, DHCP, configuration transaction, rollback, recovery, and management-safety behavior pass applicable automated and virtual-machine acceptance tests.

The privileged adapter remains deliberately incomplete. It may execute only its accepted namespace-scoped static-LAN and IPv4-forwarding subset. The complete compiled Reference Build plan must continue to fail closed until WAN DHCP, firewall/NAT, LAN DHCP, and management operations have accepted backends and observed-state/recovery behavior.

Deployment method must not create divergent Router OS products. Docker, Podman, GoreeCloud Containers, Proxmox VM, generic VM, bare-metal, cloud, system-container, and later qualified targets must reuse the canonical configuration/state/API/administration/recovery contracts. A target may be advertised as Supported only after its required environment capabilities and shared cross-environment acceptance suite pass. Missing required kernel/networking/storage/security capabilities must fail closed rather than silently downgrade Router OS behavior.

The corresponding central GoreeCloud feature-roadmap document must remain synchronized with this repository file when this roadmap materially changes.
